# Advent Of Code 2022

Hi, this will be my respository for the duration of the aoc-2022 event. 

This is my first time participating.

I will be mainly ``trying`` to solve the challenges using python, seeing as I find my self to be most "skilled" in compared ot others and it is more leanied. (Which is good &  bad)

I hope I can make it atleast trough half of the challenges and more.

There are 2 directories included
- python
- rust

I will also be ``trying`` to solve the challenges in Rust. I little to no experience in rust, but I hope I can atleast do some in rust.


Hope you enjoy!
